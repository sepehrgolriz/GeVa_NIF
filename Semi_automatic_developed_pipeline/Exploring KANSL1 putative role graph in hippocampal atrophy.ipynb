Moreover, it is also required for the specific acetylation of p53 on K120, which is crucial for the differential and optimal transcription activation of p53 target genes, both in vivo and in vitro. BTG2 (B-cell translocation gene 2) is an early growth response gene whose promoter contains p53-binding sites that is strongly regulated by p53. Interestingly, BTG2 is one of the mediators of the p53-dependent inhibition of H-Ras activity, which is involved in a variety of biological processes including cell growth, development, differentiation, senescence and cell death. This gene binds HRas (G12V) and represses its activity by reducing its GTP loading state, which, in turn, activates the Ras/MAPK signaling cascade and causes a reduction in the expression of a large number of downstream molecules. Therefore, it is plausible that dysfunction of KANSL1 might perturb the activity of p53 transcription target genes, such as BTG2, producing an aberrant regulation of important downstream cascades of Ras. This mechanism could explain the overlapping phenotypic features observed in the KANSL1 haploinsufficiency phenotype and the RASopathies. Additional clinical and experimental studies will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and further understand the molecular mechanisms associated with deleterious KANSL1 alleles.\", \"key\": \"e06274e3edce86fa398bfe283865fcb855e7378fc92f5c0f9ca05a8ace71f789c2e86adef70949f3fe3c005b7006e5542660b37731d9f895e95fde384cfee54c\", \"line\": 696, \"relation\": \"association\", \"source\": 15, \"target\": 19}, {\"annotations\": {\"Paper\": {\"Show\": true}, \"Published\": {\"CDR story\": true}, \"Subgraph\": {\"KANSL1 subgraph\": true}}, \"citation\": {\"reference\": \"22544363\", \"type\": \"PubMed\"}, \"evidence\": \" We show that haploinsufficiency of KANSL1 is sufficient to cause the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome ,a multisystem disorder characterized by intellectual disability, hypotonia and distinctive facial features.
